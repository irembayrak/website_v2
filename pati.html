        <h1>ABOUT THE PROJECT</h1>
        <p>PATI is a web app that enables pet parents to get online consultation from a verified pet expert and schedule an appointment to a vet clinic.</p>

        <h3>Client</h3>
        <p>PATI is a student project designed for Career Foundry UX Design Certified Course. </p>
        <h3>Scope</h3>
        <p>The project scope was to design 3 main features of a web app with a mobile-first approach by experiencing every stage of User-Centered Design process.</p>
        <h3>My responsibility</h3>
        <p>I was solely responsible for every phase of the process. I also refined and iterated my design based on the feedback of my tutor, mentor and peers.</p>
        <h3>Tasks</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Competitive analysis and market research</li>
          <li>User research</li>
          <li>Information architecture</li>

        <h2>Project Inspiration</h2>
        <p>The idea of designing PATI emerged from my personal experience as an expat with an unwell cat on the first day in a new country.</p>
        <h2>Challenge</h2>
        <p>Pet parents consider their pets as their children and want what is best for them. </p>
        <p>They tend not to take their pets to a clinic for every health issue because being in a clinic is stressful for pets and it might cause more health problems. Pet parents also want to avoid the long waiting and examination period in a
          clinic.</p>
        <p>They are willing to get remote help but they are not sure if they will get reliable help from a capable expert and it makes them less willing to pay for a service. </p>
        <p>Challenge is to create an app that assures pet parents about the capability and the reliability of an expert and that they will get a caring, satisfying, and warm experience.</p>

      <h2>COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS</h2>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-8">
          <p>I analyzed six products to see how they solve the pet parents’ concerns regarding their pets and performed UX focused competitive analysis for one direct competitor, PetCoach.</p>

        </div>
      </div>
      <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>There is an opportunity to stand out among the products because existing products don’t offer many options, a way to list experts and decide which one is the best for their problem. </li>
        <li>My app could stand out with a well-organized architecture, straightforward flow, and by being easy to learn, desirable and memorable.</li>
      </ul>

        <h2>USER RESEARCH</h2>

        <p>In addition to offering well structured, effective, straightforward and intuitive experience, PATI also had to be desirable, amusing and friendly just as all pet parents feel about their pets.</p>
        <p>In order to bring personality to PATI, loading screens are designed to amuse people with fun facts about pets while informing them about the progress and easing the waiting period.</p>

        <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
        <p>This project was an incredible experience as I had the chance to learn UX and UI by applying every stage of the Design Thinking Process. Working on the project alone and learning every aspect of UX was challenging but it came with
          learnings too.</P>
        <h3>Challenges</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The main challenge was to be responsible for every aspect of a product design, from UX to content, visual design, and branding while learning to use tools and improve skills.</li>
          <li>UX requires deep understanding of different disciplines. To have an understanding about every aspect of UX, reading, researching, asking and practicing is crucial and requires time.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Lessons</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Turning into student and junior again improved my learning and googling skills.</li>
          <li>When I’m stuck in the process and can’t come up with solutions, it’s important to go back to the problem that I try to solve and test or interview people to move on.</li>
        </ul>
